#Grade Calculator and GPA Predictor#
This is an interactive Python project that helps students calculate their weighted average grades and GPA based on their assignment grades, and predicts what grades they need on remaining assignments to achieve a target grade.

#Features
Input personal details (name, school, course)

Enter multiple assignments with their respective grades and weightage

Convert percentage grades to letter grades and GPA scale (4.3 scale)

Calculate current weighted average grade and GPA

Predict the grade needed on pending assignments to reach a target grade

Export the grade report to an Excel file (Report.xlsx)

#How to Use
Clone or download the repository.

Open the Jupyter notebook (Project.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Run the cells in order and follow the input prompts:
