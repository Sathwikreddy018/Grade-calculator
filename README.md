**Grade Calculator and GPA Predictor**

This is an interactive Python project that helps students calculate their weighted average grades and GPA based on their assignment grades, and predicts what grades they need on remaining assignments to achieve a target grade.

**Features**

1. Input personal details (name, school, course)
2. Enter multiple assignments with their respective grades and weightage
3. Convert percentage grades to letter grades and GPA scale (4.3 scale)
4. Calculate current weighted average grade and GPA
5. Predict the grade needed on pending assignments to reach a target grade
6. Export the grade report to an Excel file (Report.xlsx)

**How to Use**
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook (Project.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Run the cells in order and follow the input prompts:
4. Enter your name, school, and course.
5. Enter the number and names of assignments.
6. Enter grades for each assignment (enter nan if not completed).
7. Enter the weightage (credit) for each assignment.
8. View your current average grade and GPA.
9. Enter the grade you want to achieve, and the program will calculate what you need on remaining assignments.
10. Optionally, save the report as an Excel file.

**Requirements**

Python 3.x, 
Libraries: numpy, pandas, openpyxl (for saving Excel file)
